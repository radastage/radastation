/********************
/A* pathfinding algorithm
/This version updated May 2013 by Yvarov
/Returns a list of turfs along the discovered path, in order from start to finish.
/
/A* is more complex than can be easily explained here, but basically
/it checks tiles, assigning a score f = g + h where
/g = distance from start & h = minimum distance to end, and repeats with
/new tiles starting with the smallest f_score. It's capable of finding
/a path (assuming one exists), without getting stuck in wrong turns or
/unnecessarily checking unpromising tiles.
/
/The syntax for calling remains roughly the same as the version this replaces,
/minus two arguments (ones that were never given by any of
/the procs that called it anyway).

Possible procs to use for adjacency (there may be others):
/turf/proc/AdjacentTurfs
/turf/proc/AdjacentTurfsSpace
/turf/proc/CardinalTurfsWithAccess 	(best for most occasions, four-directional)

Possible procs to use for adjacency:
/turf/proc/Distance_cardinal		(requires four-directional adjacency proc)
/turf/proc/Distance					(requires eight-directional adjacency proc)

Arguments:
/turf/start_turf:	The turf to start the path from.
/turf/dest_turf:	The turf to finish the path on.
adjacent_proc:		The proc used to find adjacent tiles. When called, id is provided as an argument.
					For the best path to be found, it must only output tiles that could be reached in
					one move AND aren't occupied by something else, like a wall.
distance_proc:		Formula to use for calculating distance.
maxnodes:			Maximum _depth_ of nodes to examine; currently used only by disease.
					Not equal to the number of nodes to examine (lpct, internal) or the maximum path
					length returned (max_length below).
max_length:			If the path is longer, return only this many elements of it (starting from the front).
					It can only be shortened after finding the whole path, so doesn't save any time,
					but as different values were provided throughout the code it's kept for compatibility.
id:					Supplied to the adjacency proc for doors/etc. Default is null.
/var/turf/exclude:	Turfs to avoid when finding a path. Default is null.

Nodes not kept at all from previous version (which were never supplied):
"Mintargetdist: Minimum distance to the target before path returns, could be used to get
near a target, but not right to it - for an AI mob with a gun, for example."
"Minnodedist: Minimum number of nodes to return in the path, could be used to give a path a minimum
length to avoid portals or something i guess?? Not that they're counted right now but w/e."
