# radastation
 A station with somewhat persistent, sandbox-based design. Old as fuck, too, but hey, lag-less 99% free!
 Can only be compiled using ancient BYOND version (4.0.494.1135 of 2012 year)
 Not to mention it is using most oldest /tg/ build I could ever find (it is probably impossible to find it nowadays) so, yeah, all credits to /tg/.

UPD: sorry bros, I've fucked something up. Please, consider using stable version below:
